                    In addition to the School program, NST also organizes 2
                    weeks long summer camp each year. The camp provides children
                    with the opportunity to learn about religion, Nepalese
                    culture, history, and geography as well. It is a fun-filled
                    and highly interactive camp. The program has been rated as
                    one of the most successful programs that NST has been
                    organizing for the past couple of years.

                    In 2010, the school added one more program that was quiz
                    contest. There were 50 participants in the first quiz
                    contest. We conducted three contests at NST. This contest
                    was not for one day. Itâ€™s a 7 to 10 weeks series of quiz
                    event for one group.

                    Our team conducted a one-day quiz contest at the ANA
                    National convention 2012 organized in Dallas, Texas. The
                    kids from out of state also participated in this quiz
                    contest.

                    The quiz team has three members, Bijay Raj Bhattarai, Samir
                    Gnwali, and a team led by Mr. Binay Aryal. This program was
                    one of the best and popular programs of NST but we were
                    unable to continue due to space management at that time.
